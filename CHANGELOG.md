### 🧹 Refactors

The previous keys were renamed from `singletonManagerErrorKeys` to `SINGLETON_MANAGER_ERROR_KEYS` to enhance readability and maintainability. This change affects the enums and the corresponding references in the SingletonManager and its tests. ([50bc6ae](https://github.com/NowaraJS/singleton-manager/commit/50bc6ae))
